# Engineering Exercise Data - Lesson One

```sh
make fresh
make insert-row
```

You find yourself in a room...
That room is the stock room of your tshirt shop...
That room is full of tshirts...
How do you keep track of all of them?

Let's create a basic table with some tshirt info! Run `make fresh` to load the sample data. Then, we'll open that database in sqlite and take a peek at it. Open this particular db using `sqlite3 tshirt-inventory.db`. When you are done, you can exit using `^d`.
